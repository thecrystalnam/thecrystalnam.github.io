## About me

    <p>
    I am a PhD candidate in Korean Linguistics in the Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. My research examines Korean interaction in everyday and technology-mediated settings, with a focus on conversation analysis and human-AI interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
    My dissertation investigates how Korean speakers and AI assistants manage trouble and repair in embodied, object-oriented activities (e.g., cooking) using voice-based chatbots. Drawing on multimodal conversation analysis, I analyze how participants coordinate verbal turns, bodily actions, and material engagement as they collaborate with AI systems. This work contributes to understanding how humans negotiate intelligibility, alignment, and agency in emerging human-AI ecologies.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am also a Korean language instructor and have taught courses across the elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels. My teaching integrates interaction-based pedagogy with AI-mediated speaking activities, supporting learners’ communicative development in real-world contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
    My broader interests include interactional linguistics, pragmatics, multimodality, user-centered design for conversational AI, and the development of pedagogical practices that incorporate AI tools for language learning.
