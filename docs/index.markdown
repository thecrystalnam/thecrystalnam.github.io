## About me

    <p>
    I am a PhD student in Korean Linguistics in the Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. My research examines Korean interaction in everyday and technology-mediated settings, with a focus on conversation analysis and human-AI interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am also a Korean language instructor and have taught courses across the elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels. My teaching integrates interaction-based pedagogy with AI-mediated speaking activities, supporting learners’ communicative development in real-world contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
    My broader interests include interactional linguistics, pragmatics, multimodality, user-centered design for conversational AI, and the development of pedagogical practices that incorporate AI tools for language learning.
